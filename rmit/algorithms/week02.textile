h1. Week 2 - Analysis Fundamentals of Algorithm Efficiency

*Basic asymptotic efficiency classes*

table(grid simple).
|_. Class |_. Name |_. Comments |
| 1 | _constant_ | Algorithm's running time typically goes to infinity when its input size grows infinitely large |
| log _n_ | _logarithmic_ | A result of cutting a problem's size by a constant factor on each iteration of the algorithm |
| _n_ | _linear_ | Algorithms that scan a list of size _n_ (sequential search) |
| _n_ log _n_ | _linearithmic_ | Many divide-and-conquer algorithms including mergesort and quicksort (average case) |
| _n_ ^2^ | _quadratic_ | Two embedded loops; elementary sorting; operations on _n_ x _n_ matrices |
| _n_ ^3^ | _cubic_ | Three embedded loops; non-trivial algorithms from linear algebra |
| 2 ^_n_^ | _exponential_ | Algorithms that generate subsets of an _n_-element set |
| _n_! | _factorial_ | Algorithms that generate all permutations of an _n_-element set |
