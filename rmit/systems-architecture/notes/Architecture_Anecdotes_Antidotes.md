Architecture, Anecdotes and Antidotes
=====================================

(Understanding the architecture function in organisations)

The value of architecture: how do you sell architecture (particularly to management).

Architecture is thought _leadership_ about how to use technology to improve buisness outcomes.

Good arch is often noticed more by sh absence th its presence.

Architecture should only be considered successful when _projects_ are successful & systems are delivering against targeted service levels.

Failure of architecture is failure of leadership.

Disciplines of architecture: enterprise, domain, solution

Domain architects understand one domain deeply, such as security.

Solution architects provide the technological solution for a problem, and need a general understanding of multiple areas of technology.

Enterprise architects plan technology for the organization. Harder problems lie here, and require thought leadership.

Key organizational attributes to watch out for
----------------------------------------------

### Productivity

* Is the organisation productive?
* Is IT enhancing the productivity of staff within the organization?
* How significantly does the cost of IT limit implementation of business strategies?
* Is there a discernible link between most IT activities & the delivery of value? Are KPIs "real" at all levels of the IT organization?
* Are IT strategies beign implemented successfully? Do businesses agree?
* Are projects that include significant IT components delivering their stated benefits? How many times are projects completed?

### Economies of scale

* Are economies of scale being produced by the IT organization in areas where they would normally be expected?
* Do the various stakeholders of IT help or hinder the realisation of economies of scale?
* Do business units regularly pool investment in IT to get the benefits of economies of scale? Are the benefits delivered?
* What capabilities and skill levels are necessary for staff to deliver economies of scale?

### Innovation

* How is innovation in technology driving value for business units?
* Who is doing this innovation and how is it funded?
* Is innnovation ever applied internally to the organisation strcutrue and the processes that are used within the organisation?
* Is technology contributing in a postiive or negative way to the brand identity?
* What aspects of brand identity are significantly dependent on IT for their authenticity?
* Does IT hinder the business in establishing its brand identity?

### Risk

* Do projects fail because of "technical" surprises?
* Are architects more visible when projects are failing or when they are succeeding?
* What is normally the root cause of system failure?
* Who is most likely blamed for project failure? Who is most likely credited with project success?
* What is the risk management culture of IT?
* How are technology risks mitigated?

The role of architecture is to avoid loss of revenue.

### Complexity

* Are the organization's systems complex?
* All large corporations clail that they want to reduce the complexity of their systems.
* Who in the organisation understands the complexity of the current systems? Who endorses changes to these systems?
* What design techniques are used to reduce the complexity of systems?
* How does IT management support the reduction of complexity?

Understand the complexity inherent in the domain. The analysis often leads to deeper understanding than the specialists who use the system.

Structure within the organization: plan / build / run

For solution architecture, you have to understand the end-to-end processes.

Business, Application, Information and Technology Architecture roles. Also specialists in Microsoft, IBM; and industry-vertical specialists: Finance, Telcos, Utilities.
