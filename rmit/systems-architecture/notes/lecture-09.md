# Lecture 9 - Architectural Styles

### Architectural style

* Set of rules that prescribe the types of components, interfaces and connectors are used in a system (vocabulary / metaphor)
* Structure defined by combination of connectors and components
* System behaviour
* Guidelines that support the application of the style
* Several styles may be present in an architecture

### Examples

* Client-server model
	- 2-tier
	- n-tier
	- peer-to-peer
	- cloud computing
* Database-centric architecture
* Distributed computing
* Event-driven architecture
* Service-oriented architecture
* Rule evaluation
* Front-end, back-end

### User interface styles

* Thin client
* Portal client
* Rich thin client
* Distributed rich client (aka Thick Client)

### Module styles

* Layers
* Multi-tier

### Integration styles

* Remote Procedure Invocation
* Message router (broker)
* Pipes and filters
	- translators
* Channels and queues
	- channel adapters
* Messaging bridge
* Message bus
* Publish / Subscribe

### Service-oriented Architecture
