# Chapter 14: On To Object Design

<div class="guideline">
	<h4>Guideline</h4>
	<p>Spend significant time drawing _interaction_ diagrams (sequence or communication diagrams), not just class diagrams.</p>
	<p>Ignoring this guideline is a very common worst-practice with UML.</p>
</div>

__Dynamic models__ illustrate key interactions and logic, such as sequence diagrams.

__Static models__ illustrate organizational concepts, such as class or package diagrams. 

<div class="guideline">
	<h4>Object Design Skill vs. UML Notation Skill</h4>
	<p>Drawing UML is a reflection of making decisions about the design.</p>
	<p>The object design skills are what matter, not knowing how to draw UML. Fundamental object design requires knowledge of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>principles of responsibility assignment</li>
		<li>design patterns</li>
	</ul>
