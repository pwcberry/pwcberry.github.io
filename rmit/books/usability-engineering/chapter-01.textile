h2. Scenario-Based Usability Engineering

h3. The emergence of usability

As interactive systems became more complex and involved a more diverse range of users, *usability* became a concern with regard to how a system was easy to understand and promoted user satisfaction.  

Three distinct perspectives contribute to the understanding of usability:

* human performance
* learning and cognition
* collaborative activity

h3. Non-functional requirements that may influence usability concerns

|_.Issue|_.Potential Impacts on Usability|
|Team membership| Failure to include usability experts on a team will limit attention to and resolution of usability concerns|
|Project size| Large complex projects are more difficult to coordinate and may lead to a focus on a few high-level, most critical usability issues; time limits will correspondingly limit teh amount of iteration possible|
|Legacy systems| Prior commitment to existing hardware or software platforms may ocverconstrain the design space, eliminating some options that would significantly improve usability|
|Portability| The need to build multiple compatible versions of a system may encourage development of a "lowest common denominator"|
|Reliability| A need for highly reliable systems may require a distributed or otherwise complex architecture that later is reflected in the user interface|
|Maintainability| A system intended for a long lifetime may be designed in a modular fashion that separates tasks and activities seen as highly interrelated by users|
|Software economics| The technology cost of a useful function or user interface technique may be too prohibitive to warrant its inclusion in the design|

h3. Characteristic elements of a user interaction scenario

|_.Scenario Element|_.Definition|_.Examples|
|Setting|Situational details that motivate or explain goals, actions, and reactions of the actors(s)|Office within an accounting organization; state of work area|
|Actors|Human(s) interacting with the computer or other setting elements; personal characteristics relevant to scenario (personas)|Accountant using a spreadsheet website for the first time|
|Task goals|Effects on the situation that motivate actions carried out by actor(s)|Need to compare budget data with values questioned in email|
|Plans|Mental activity directed at converting a goal into a behaviour|Opening the email to resize the window to align with spreadsheet program|
|Evaluation|Mental activity directed at interpreting features of the situation|A window that is too large can be hiding the window underneath; dark borders indicate a window is active|
|Actions|Observable behaviour|Opening an application; reorganizing tabs within application|
|Events|External actions or reactions produced by the computer or other features of the setting; some of these may be hidden to the actor(s) but important to scenario|Window movement; haptic feedback from keyboard or mouse|
