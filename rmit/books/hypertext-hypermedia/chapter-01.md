# Chapter 1. Defining Hypertext and Hypermedia

Hypertext is _nonsequential_ when compared to the sequential nature of the information in books. It is possible for a reader to move through alternate paths of an hypertext application.

Each unit of information within hypertext is a _node_, and each unit is pointed to other units via _links_. The number of links is not normally fixed in advance but depends on the content of each node. Some nodes are related to many others and will therefore have many links; other nodes are destination nodes and have no outgoing links. 

A hypertext link connects two nodes and is normally directed in the sense that it points from one node (the _anchor node_) to another (_destination node_). Typically the link is anchored at a certain word (or phrase) in the departure node that is activated when the user is allowed to click on the link.

True hypertext should make users _feel_ that they can move freely through the information according to their own needs. This means short response times so that the text is on the screen as soon as the user asks for it. Small overhead also requries low cognitive load when navigating so that users do not spend their time wondering what the computer will do or how to get it to do what they want.

The "look and feel" of a hypertext application is what defines it as hypertext, not so much the features that comprise the application.

_Hypermedia_ is the term employed when the application comprises other multimedia components, such as video and audio, along with the text.

One of the important advantages of hypertext is that it is a method for integrating three technologies and industries that have been separate until recently: publishing, computing and broadcasting (TV and film). 

Hypertext also provides the opportunity to publish information structures to the general public in much the same way as books or newspapers are [currently] published. These information structures would be based primarily on moving images, in the tradition of the film and animation industries, and would be under computer control to allow for user interaction.
