# Chapter 3. The History of Hypertext

## Memex (1945)

[Vannevar Bush (1890-1974)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) conceived the memex ("memory extender") in 1945. He publicized the idea in an article published by _The Atlantic_, "As We May Think". The memex was never built.

Bush described the memex as a "sort of mechanized private file and library" and as "a device in which an individual stores his books, records and communications, and which is mechanized so that it be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". The memex would store this information on microfilm.

The main reason Vannevar Bush developed his proposal for the memex was that he was worried about the explosion of scientific information which made it impossible even for specialists to follow developments in a discipline.

Bush wrote:

> a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select 
> immediately and automatically another. This is the essential
> feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is
> the important thing.

In addition to the establishment of individual links, Bush also wanted the memex to support the building of trails through the material in the form of a set of links that would combine information of relevance for a specific perspective on a specific topic. Bush even forecast the establishment of a new profession of "trial blazers", "who find delight in the task of establishing userful trails through the enormous mass of the common record".

## Augment/NLS (1962-1976)

[Doug Englebart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) started work in 1962 on his Augment Project with a mission to augment human capabilities and productivity with computer tools. Some of the areas of research included office automation and text processing.

However, it was a system utilized during the project that had several hypertext features but it was developed as a hypertext system: NLS (for oN-Line System). During the Augment project, the researchers stored all their papers, reports and memos in a shared "journal" facility that enabled them to include cross-references to other work in their own writings. The journal grew to over 100,000 items and is still unique as a hypertext structure for support of real work over an extended time.

## Xanadu (1965)

[Ted Nelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) coined the word "hypertext" in 1965. His vision is embodied in his Xanadu project: a repository for _everything_ that anybody has ever written and thereby comprising a universal hypertext. The Xanadu project was founded in 1960.

The Xanadu design embodies local and remote storage of data; when a user activates a link in the front-end a back-end repository is accessed. Xanadu will not delete text; version control will be required to ensure all links are up to date and that the current version of the hypertext node is available, including its history.

Nelson is unconcered about the size of storage required. Nonetheless, a single system that allows people to link with everybody else will impose strains on the traditional view of copyright. Such copyright concerns may be alleviated by keeping track of the original authorship and provide royalties to the original author based on the number of bytes seen by each reader.

## Hypertext Editing System (1967) and FRESS (1968)

The Hypertext Editing System was the world's first working hypertext system. It ran in a 128K memory partition on a small IBM/360 mainframe and was funded by an IBM research contract.

FRESS (File Retrieval and Editing System) was created at Brown University as a follow-up to the Hypertext Editing System and also implemented on an IBM mainframe. It was incredibly stable, and the code still ran more than 20 years later.

Both of these systems had the basic hypertext functionality of linking and jumping to other documents.

## Aspen Movie Map (1978)

The first example of hypermedia, developed at the MIT Architecture Machine Group (now merged into the Media Lab), was a surrogate travel application to allow users to "drive" through city of Aspen, Colorado on a computer screen.

The system was implemented with a set of videodisks containing photographs of all the streets of Aspen. Filming was performed by mounting four cameras aimed at 90 degree intervals on a truck that was driven through all the city streets, each camera taking a frame every three metres.

The street view was navigated by a joystick. The videodisk player could in theory display one frame per 33 milliseconds giving the user the impression of driving at 330 km/h.

Two monitors were used: one gave an immersive view of the city and a second showed a street map to provide the user with an overview of the environment. A user may stop the drive and enter a building.
