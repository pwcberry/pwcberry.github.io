Software Architecture Concepts
------------------------------

A __computer system__: the software elements to be specified or designed in order to meet a set of requirements and the hardware that the software elements will run on.

The __architecture__ of a system is the set of fundamental concepts or properties of the system in its environment, embodied in its elements, relationships, and the principles of its design and evolution.

### System Elements and Relationships

The elements that constitute a system and the relationships between them define the structure of the system. There are two types of structures:

The __static structures__ define the system's internal design-time elements and their arrangement. These elements may be programs, object-oriented classes or packages, database stored procedures, services or any other self-contained code unit. Internal data elmements include classes, RDBs, data files. Internal hardware elements include CPUs, network elements, or hard disks. The static arrangement defines the relationships between these elements.

The __dynamic structures__ define the system's runtime elements and their interactions. Such interactions can be information flows between elements, execution of internal tasks, or the effects they have on data.
