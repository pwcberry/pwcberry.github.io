# Chapter 1 - Risk: The Basic Problem

Some examples of risk, and how XP addresses each risk: 

__Schedule slips__

* Shorter release cycles to limit slippage
* Customer-requested features worked on for each iteration between releases
* Implement highest priority features first

__Project cancelled__

* Customer chooses the smallest release that makes the most business sense and limits what can go wrong

__System goes sour__

* XP promotes a comprehensive suite of tests that are actively maintained
* XP always keeps the system in prime condition

__Defect rate__

* Unit tests (programmer) and user-acceptance tests (customer) ensures defect rate remains low

__Business misunderstood__

* Customer is an integral member of the team
* Project specification is continually refined

__Business changes__

* XP shortens release cycle, limiting change between releases
* Customer is welcome to substitute new funcitonality for functionality not yet completed during a release

__False feature rich__

* Only the highest priority tasks are worked on

__Staff turnover__

* Programmers accept responsibility for estimating and completing their own work
* Feedback is given about the actual time taken to complete work so estimates can improve
* Rules for who makes and changes estimates are clear
* Human contact within team is encouraged


# Chapter 3 - Economics of Software Development

Software project management can involve four kinds of options:

* __Option to abandon__: Something is gained from the project before it is cancelled. 
* __Option to switch__: Change direction of the project. A strategy that allows for customers to change their tack mid-way through the project is a good strategy.
* __Option to defer__: Wait until the situation has sorted itself out before investing.
* __Option to grow__: When a market looks like it is taking off, grow quickly to take advantage of the opportunities. A strategy that can scale gracefully given increased investment.

Five factors are involved in assessing the option to take:

* Amount of investment required to get the option
* Price at which you can purchase the prize if you exercised the option
* Current value of the prize
* Amount of time which you can exercise the option
* Uncertainty in the eventual value of the prize

# Chapter 4 - Four Variables

A model of software development involves four variables:

* Cost
* Time
* Quality
* Scope




* Project cancelled
* System goes sour
* Defect rate
* Business misunderstood
* Business changes
* False feature rich
* Staff turnover
