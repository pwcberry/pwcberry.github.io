# Tutorial Week 4

## 1. 

Resource allocation - availability of people to complete tasks within the duration specified in the project plan

## 2. 

Focus of PM is different: 

a) effort required to complete project by a date
b) spread of effort with limited resources

## 3. 

"Too much time available, leave until last minute"; make a "fake deadline" to induce urgency but the real deadline is then announced (as slack)

Balance between unrealistic deadlines and slack time

## 4.

Growth curves; perform more research

From which project is preferred to extract a resource? S or J?

## 5.
