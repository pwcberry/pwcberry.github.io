## Week 2

5 Stages in the project lifecycle:

1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring & Controlling
5. Closing

Software development occurs at stage 3. Perhaps in stage 4.

__Projectized__: The organization where every activity is a project

__Weak Matrix Organization__: Feedback from staff upwards.

The authority of a project manager differs according to the type of organizational structure. (Functional, Matrix, Projectized) (Weakest -> Strongest)

__Work breakdown structure__: The tasks required for a successful project are first broken down into the process groups. Then these tasks are divided and subdivided according to roles and resources.

A Project Charter: 1st assignment.

Once a stage is completed, an artefact is produced by the project manager.

At the end of the initiating phase, a Project Charter is produced.

At the end of the planning phase, the Project Plan is produced.

Stage 4 is concurrent to Stage 3.

### Project Charter

__Boundaries__: Itemize the out-of-scope deliverables.

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

* Comprehensive list of tasks and sub-tasks that lead to a milestone. Against each sub-task is duration, resources and predecessors.
* Numbering of tasks is important: identification & sequencing
* Outline the WBS using I, P, E, M, C
* (R)esponsible, (A)ccountable, (C)onsult, (I)nformed -> the matrix should be considered before / alongside development of WBS

### Risk Analysis

* Prioritize - determine severity of failure (may also hedge risks)
* Threats - a type of risk to project success, or even a motivation for the project
* Detectability == anticipation
