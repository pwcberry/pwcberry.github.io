# Software Engineering Project Management (ISYS1106)

[Course Guide](http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/isys11061550)

[Project Management in Pratice](./books/pm-practice/)

# Weekly Notes

## Week 1

[Study: 68 percent of IT projects fail](http://www.zdnet.com/article/study-68-percent-of-it-projects-fail/)

[IEEE: Why Software Fails](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails)

[Coding Horror: The Long, Dismal History of Software Project Failure](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-long-dismal-history-of-software-project-failure/)

## Week 2

5 Stages in the project lifecycle:

1. Initiating
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring & Controlling
5. Closing

Software development occurs at stage 3. Perhaps in stage 4.

__Projectized__: The organization where every activity is a project

__Weak Matrix Organization__: Feedback from staff upwards.

The authority of a project manager differs according to the type of organizational structure. (Functional, Matrix, Projectized) (Weakest -> Strongest)

__Work breakdown structure__: The tasks required for a successful project are first broken down into the process groups. Then these tasks are divided and subdivided according to roles and resources.

A Project Charter: 1st assignment.

Once a stage is completed, an artefact is produced by the project manager.

At the end of the initiating phase, a Project Charter is produced.

At the end of the planning phase, the Project Plan is produced.

Stage 4 is concurrent to Stage 3.

### Project Charter

__Boundaries__: Itemize the out-of-scope deliverables.

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

* Comprehensive list of tasks and sub-tasks that lead to a milestone. Against each sub-task is duration, resources and predecessors.
* Numbering of tasks is important: identification & sequencing
* Outline the WBS using I, P, E, M, C (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing)
* (R)esponsible, (A)ccountable, (C)onsult, (I)nformed -> the matrix should be considered before / alongside development of WBS

### Risk Analysis

* Prioritize - determine severity of failure (may also hedge risks)
* Threats - a type of risk to project success, or even a motivation for the project
* Detectability == anticipation

## Week 3

## Week 4

Network diagrams

* Concern is for major tasks (activities)
* Challenging job: scheduling, budgeting and risk management
    - How much slack time is available to finish project on time
* Critical path: the path that takes the most time and any delay will compound to push the project finishing date out past the deadline

AON Network

* How much time can I pad for each activity
* `ES + duration = EF`
* `LS + duration = LF`
* Forward pass over diagram: ES / EF
* Backward pass over diagram: LS / LF

### Sample Project Charter

Every part of the report has to be uniquely identified.

High-Level Requirements: Business requirements; not technical requirements; features that are in plain English

Repeated information: the parts of the Charter may be read by other readers

Boundaries: in-scope features; out-of-scope features

Project stages

1. Initiating
2. Planning
    * Requirements gathering
3. Execution
4. Closing
5. Monitoring & Control
    * Starts happening from stage 2
    * Start date / end date of project 
    * Reports

Budgeting:
* Research into costs for equipment and contactors
* Assumption for PM to be a Scrum Master
* Budget properties to consider: training, wages, administrative, technical; contingency reserve

[System Administrator / Dev Ops] => project costs for cloud provisioning

Constraints - (Training)

FMEA

Software / Planning / Financial / Training / Loss of Staff

### Monitoring and Controlling

[Prochain Video](www.prochain.com)

__Earned value (EV)__

* Variances - negative variance is bad

__Example for EV__

Work on project expected to cost: 1500 (PV)

## Week 5

Research:

## Week 6

"We are going to check"

SADBET - Project Management Governance

Agile only works with experienced developers.   

### RUP

[RUP - Work Components](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/5317.html)

For each of the milestones of an RUP project, it becomes a sub-project that includes inception, elaboration, construction and transition.

Gantt Charts are incompatible with agile projects as these charts are static and very difficult to keep up to date as the project evolves.

[Small Project Development Case: Inception](http://sce.uhcl.edu/helm/rationalunifiedprocess/examples/devcase_sp/sip_iii.htm)

### Scrum

Product owner is most likely not a technical person who may be in a position to not trust the scrum development team. The Scrum Master acts as a facilitator, translator and mentor.

Project Management is shared by the product owner, scrum master and the development team. 

Scrum only applies to the software development phase of the product development lifecycle.

Requirements are gathered before development commences.
