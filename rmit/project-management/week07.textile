h1. Week 7

h2. ScrumBut Symptoms

* Failed customer demo demoralizes the team
* Team members are afraid to try new ideas because they might fail
* Retrospectives focus on who rather than what

h2. Other Scrum terms

h3. Spike

A story or task aimed at answering a question or gathering information, rather than at producing shippable product. "Spike - Agile Dictionary":http://agiledictionary.com/209/spike/.

A spike:

* May discover the work cannot be implemented for any practical purpose
* May discover the work can be used for great benefit on future stories
* Is not to implement the completed work "as is"
* Must have clear objectives and outcomes
* Must be timeboxed

h3. Tracer Bullet

A very narrow implementation in production quality of an epic/large user story and is usually an indicator that the user story is too large in estimation. "Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!":http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/

The purpose of a tracer bullet is to examine how an end-to-end process will work to assess its feasibility. "Agile Dictionary - Tracer Bullet":http://www.requirementally.com/agile-dictionary-tracer-bullet/

h3. Abnormal Termination

An abnormal termination is essentially blowing up the sprint and starting a new sprint instead. An abnormal termination is most frequently the result of a dramatic shift in business priorities - something previously considered important is no longer important, or something even more important is discovered. "Making the Decision to Abnormally Terminate a Sprint":http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/making-the-decision-to-abnormally-terminate-a-sprint

Reasons for an Abnormal Sprint Termination may include, but are not limited to:

* The company changes direction
* Market forces render the work obsolete
* A major technology change occurs
* A better technical solution is found that makes the current Sprintâ€™s activity throwaway work
* Fundamental and urgent external changes that invalidate the Sprint Goal or the bulk of the functionality
* Urgent bug fix or feature development request that cannot wait until the normal completion of the Sprint
