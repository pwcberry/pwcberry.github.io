h1. Week 9

h2. Lean principles used by Toyota

# Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals
# Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface
# Use "pull" systems to avoid overproduction
# Level out the workload (_heijunka_)
# Build a culture of stopping to fix the problems, to get the quality right the first time
# Standardise tasks and processes
# Use visual control so no problems are hidden
# Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes
# Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others
# Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy
# Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve
# Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation (management by wondering)
# Make decisions slowly by consensus, throughly considering all options, _and then implement decisions rapidly_
# Become a learning organization through relentless reflection and continuous improvement

* Lack of consideration of human aspects
* Lack of creativity
* Promotes culture of incrementalism

* Does not apply to every project

h2. Agile Practices Found in Industry

* Cross-functional teams
* Iterative and incremental development
* Feature-driven development
* Planning game
* Co-location
* Pair programming

h2. Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)

Risk-value delivery lifecycle:

* goal-driven
* enterprise aware
* scalable

Hybrid approach that extends Scrum and blends strategies from:

* Agile Modelling
* Extreme Programming
* Unified Process
* Kanban
* Lean (Software Development)

DAD addresses full end-to-end delivery lifecycle of software development, not just the construction phase focussed on by Scrum.
