# Understanding What Software Developers Talk About

Software developers have their own way for explaining the problems they encounter and the intentions behind their
solutions. Their jargon is often opaque to their colleagues who don’t write code. In this post, I attempt to illuminate
for non-developers the main subject areas that developers discuss in their day-to-day activities without going into too
much detail about their vocabulary.

## Introduction

In the realm of websites and web applications, software developers can be divided into two camps: front-end developers
and back-end developers. Additionally, the term “full-stack developer” is used by someone who identifies as both.

A front-end developer spends most of their time writing code to run inside a browser. A back-end developer spends most
of their time writing code to run inside a server or database, or to write code for The Cloud. More about this later.

In some organizations there may also be quality engineers and system engineers that assist with the production of
software. Additionally, an organization may have delivery managers, security engineers, architects, and others who have
a responsibility in ensuring the timely release of software to the Internet.

Amongst these roles, particularly the developers, is a language that has common topics, such as:

* Programming languages
* Software libraries
* Data exchange and JSON
* Tools
* Git (version control system)
* Build systems

Yet developers have concerns that are specific to their role.

First, let’s explore topics that developers have in common.

## Programming Languages

The foundation of code, a programming language has one primary task: inform other developers what the software design
is. The secondary task is to instruct the computer to perform a sequence of actions.

A programming language, like human language, has a grammar and a syntax; it has rules. These are strict rules, and when
a rule is broken the programmer will encounter an error like a “syntax error” or “incompatible type error”. These
messages are generated by the program when it is converting the language into something the computer can understand.

Often the language contains words that do have some resemblance to English. Words such as `for`, `while`, `interface`
and `class`. There will be other symbols that were originally part of English grammar and punctuation but now have
different meanings. The semicolon, for example, can cause arguments to break out between JavaScript programmers. The use
of space on lines of code can frustrate Python and Ruby programmers if there is too much or not enough.

Here's an example of JavaScript code:

```javascript
const months = ["", "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
    "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];

const formatDate = (value) => {
    const [y, m, d] = value.split("-").map(s => parseInt(s));
    return !isNaN(d) ? `${d} ${months[m]} ${y}` : `${months[m]} ${y}`.trim();
}; 
```

### Code reviews

Programming, despite the “lone hacker” myth, is a social activity and the code produced by this activity is subject to
review. This review usually occurs when it is ready for a “pull request” (see below). This “code review” is generally an
opportunity for other programmers, not directly involved with the problem the code is attempting to solve, to ensure the
code meets certain standards for:

* Comprehension
* Style
* Risk (for new bugs)
* Purpose

These standards may be “industry standard”, “company standard”, “team standard” or completely arbitrary.

### Choosing a language

How do programmers or developers decide what language they will use to write the software? There are a number of
factors, such as:

* Familiarity of the programmers with the language
* It’s new and it would be exciting to try
* It can be deployed to a server in production
* It contains elements of a “functional language” (see note below)

But it could also be that a language is not chosen because it does not meet this previous list of factors.

Additionally, programmers may not choose a language based on typical human traits such as:

* Prejudice e.g. “Oh, it’s invented by Company Z, we’re not going to touch that”
* Rumour e.g. “I heard that Company XY used it and they’ve had nothing but trouble since then”
* Regret e.g. “I used it once 2 years ago and it burned me. Not going near it again”

**Functional language**

When a programming language is considered “functional” there are strict rules for how code uses and moves data through
the software. It is a paradigm that is compared against the more dominant “object-oriented” approach where objects are
coded to handle changes to, and movement of, data.

## Software Libraries

  </picture>

</figure>

It is apparently a virtue in the software industry that a good developer is a “lazy developer”. A lazy developer will
find ways to be economical with their time. Repetition is a bane to all developers and is not a great use of their time.
They would rather let the computer do all that menial work.

A lazy developer will also look for code that has already been written that solves their problem. Now this code may not
be a 100% fit, but if it’s close enough and “free” (i.e. open source), then that’ll satisfy the lazy developer’s needs.
This code is a “software library”. It provides components and functions to help the developer keep moving and focussed
on delivery of the feature.

Software libraries are discussed in terms of modules, API (application programmable interface), components, interfaces,
documentation, or its actual source code; this is the “developer experience” or DX. While a library doesn’t need to have
excellent DX for it to be used, its longevity is defined by how long developers put up with frustration before finding
another library or writing their own version. A library considered to have great DX is React, the tool of choice for
building UIs by front-end developers.

Choosing a library is also based on the same factors for choosing a programming language.

### Software frameworks

When a “framework” is talked about, it is usually at the beginning of a project because they can be one of the most
significant pieces of a software project.

There are different scales of frameworks, such as .NET or Angular JS, but for the purposes of this document, you can
imagine a framework as a collection of libraries.

## Data Exchange and JSON

For the front-end to display information in the browser, it has to communicate its needs with the back-end.

When the browser requests a URL from the back-end it is performing an HTTP request. The back-end server can respond with
the expected data or send back an error such as “not found” or “internal server error”. This is the data exchange
between the front-end and back-end - a URL is a piece of data (it identifies the resource); a CSS file or an image are
types of data the server sends to the front-end.

A URL (uniform resource location) is made up of important parts to help the identification of a resource on a server:

<figure>
    <picture>
        <source srcset="/assets/2021-02-22/url-breakdown.png" media="(max-width: 600px)"/>
        <source srcset="/assets/2021-02-22/url-breakdown@2x.png" media="(min-width: 601px)" />
        <img src="/assets/2021-02-22/url-breakdown.jpg" alt="URL breakdown, following HTTP: The Definitive Guide" />
    </picture>
    <figcaption>After&nbsp;<em>HTTP: The Definitive Guide</em></figcaption>
</figure>

This data exchange also occurs when a user clicks a link or a button that triggers an HTTP request. Traditionally this
means the entire page is updated. However, in modern web application development, this usually results in a partial
update to the UI. This type of data exchange relies on JavaScript and a data format known as JSON.

JSON (pronounced as JAY-SON, it means JavaScript Object Notation) is the de-facto format in the software industry
because it is text-based, has a simple set of rules, and is human-readable (good for debugging). It is also easy for
JavaScript to digest and use in the updates of UIs.

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "title": "Understanding What Software Developers Talk About",
  "category": "philosophy",
  "tags": [
    "design",
    "front-end",
    "programming"
  ],
  "year": 2021
}
```

The back-end will send JSON to the front-end in the data exchange usually as a method of moving raw data from the
database to the front-end.

## Tools

When it comes to software, the instruments that a developer relies on for day-to-day productivity are:

* Their computer
* Their favourite text editor
* Their command-line terminal
* Implements created by software to aid software production
* Their mug

This list is not exhaustive and points 1 - 4 will often be a cause for debate amongst developers.

### Computers

“What does your computer run?” This type of question is usually to start a dialog of comparison between the hardware
specs and operating system pros and cons that exist on developers’ computers. The choice of computer is usually mandated
by their employer but they may be given the opportunity to use their preferred operating system. Otherwise the developer
is stuck with an operating system they end up loathing for various reasons and will describe at length during lunch (or
any given opportunity).

Windows, Mac, or Linux? This decision for an operating system is usually based on the same criteria as choosing a
programming language if the developer is given the opportunity.

### Text editors

Developers need a place to transfer their ideas into code and it is the text editor as the computer application that
allows them to do so.

A fancy, bells-and-whistles, text editor is called an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE). An IDE will combine the
text-editing facility with other tools that aids the production of software. Visual Studio, IntelliJ, JetBrains
WebStorm, and Sublime Text are examples.

Some developers eschew these extra facilities and will use a simpler text editor such as Vim, Emacs or something
obscure. These editors exist in the command line terminal.

Developers settle on their editor of choice by how well it suits their intellectual muscles.

    </picture>

</figure>

### Command-line terminal

This is a bare-bones window that incorporates a “shell” through which developers can issue commands directly to the
operating system. It is this place where developers will use their software tools to aid in the production of software
such as run tests, check code style or save the code changes in their version control system (see below).

    </picture> 
    <figcaption>The terminal window showing the command-line interface of a "shell"</figcaption>
</figure>

### Software instruments

These are small programs that assist developers to verify and validate their code. Back-end and front-end developers
have different instruments but in general they fall into these categories:

* Test utilities (for unit tests, integration tests and “end-to-end” tests)
* Code style checkers (known as “linters”)
* Version control systems (usually Git; see below)
* Other hand-made utilities to produce artefacts to experiment or test with (known as “scripts”) written in a
  programming language of choice

### Mugs

Probably not as important as the preceding four topics but if my favourite mug goes missing from the kitchen, I will be disappointed,
and will begin the search for it in case I _did_ misplace it.

## Version Control Systems

It’s standard practice for developers to keep backups of their code in a place that isn’t on their own computers.
Usually the backups are stored on a server somewhere else in the world; that server might be owned by an entity like
Github or Atlassian’s Bitbucket. This process of protecting source code is called “version control”.

The version control tool that is pretty much the industry standard these days is called “Git”. Git allows developers to work on
different versions of a code base, called branches or forks, that do not cause disruption to the code that is working in
production. These branches, when stored in Github or Bitbucket, are kept separate to the main or “master” branch (version) 
of the code that is used in production.

Git also allows developers to fix up their mistakes, track who wrote what line of code, and provide a history of all the
changes that have occurred.

  </picture>

</figure>

When developers are finished with the work on a feature, and it is ready to be “merged” into the main part of the code,
the developers will “create a pull request”. A pull request gives the authors an opportunity to explain why the changes
were made. A pull request also gives other developers a chance to review the changes, also known as a “code review”. If
the changes pass the review, then the code can be merged into the “master” or “main” branch. If not, then the authors
have to address the feedback of the reviewers and when ready, request another review of the code to hopefully bring the 
pull request closer to merging.

## Build Systems

“The build is broken”. A phrase, when spoken, is in a tone of stark seriousness. It may also be referred to in an ironic
manner: “X broke the build this morning!”.

But what’s happened? What is “The Build”?

In fact, the build refers to a system that covers these concepts:

* Build tools
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Deployment

Much like programming languages, developers make their choices for each of the components that a team uses for these
processes.

### Build tools

These take all the text files containing code and translate (“compile”) these into artefacts that the computer can
understand. These artefacts are then used by the web server for back-end code or even in the browser (e.g. TypeScript
converted to JavaScript).

### Continuous integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is the process where code is taken from its repository, built, tested, and then packaged for
deployment.

These are machines, often working on an in-house server or in The Cloud, that operate when a pull request has occurred.
When the pull request is successfully merged, Github or Bitbucket will send the code to these CI machines. If all the
operations do not experience an error, artefacts are generated that will be deployed into production.

It is “continuous” in the sense that any successful change of code will trigger this process and no human intervenes.

Typical CI environments are Jenkins, Hudson, Buildkite, Bitbucket, TeamCity and Travis CI.

  </picture>
  <figcaption>Buildkite, a continuous integration and continuous deployment tool. Here this image shows successful builds</figcaption>
</figure>

### Continuous Deployment

Like CI, but it adds the operation for setting up the production environment and placing the artefacts generated by CI
into that environment.

The production environment may be hosted Amazon Web Services (AWS); Microsoft Azure; Google Cloud Platform (GCP);
Heroku; Netlify; or something else that is in The Cloud.

### DevOps

This area of software production is the purview of developer operations, referred to as “DevOps”. In the past this was
the domain of specialist engineers such as the Systems Engineer or Site/Systems Reliability Engineer (SRE). In recent
times, it has become a responsibility for developers. In fact, in some organizations, it is part of Team Managed
Infrastructure (TMI) and system engineers provide assistance when needed.
 
## Genre of Developer

Let's cover the types of developer one finds in teams who produce software.

### Back-end developer

<figure>
  <picture>
    <source srcset="/assets/2021-02-22/back-end-developer@2x.png" media="(max-width: 600px)"/>
    <source srcset="/assets/2021-02-22/back-end-developer.png" media="(min-width: 601px)"/>
    <img src="/assets/2021-02-22/back-end-developer.jpg" alt="Back-end developer figure" width="640" />
  </picture>
</figure>

**What they do:**  
Writes code for a web server, application server, system infrastructure, cloud infrastructure, or a database.

**What they talk about:**  
The following is a list of topics specific to back-end developers:

| --- | --- | --- |
| Topic | Category | Extra comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ASP.NET | Software Framework | Microsoft |
| .NET | Software Framework | Microsoft |  
| C# | Programming Language | Microsoft |
| SQL query | Programming Language | The language of most databases to retrieve or manipulate data |
| Database performance | System | How fast a database can respond to requests for data or how quick it can store data changes |
| REST | Web Services / API | Conceptual framework for organizing data and  resources |
| Java | Programming Language | Oracle / open source |
| Spring | Web Services / API | Software framework for building websites, REST programs or other APIs |
| Ruby on Rails | Software Framework / API | Popular framework, using the Ruby programming language, for building websites and web APIs |
| Python | Programming Language | Popular with data scientists and system engineers due to its simple yet expressive syntax |
| Scala | Programming Language | Popular with programmers who don’t like Java but like functional languages |
| Node | System Instrument | A tool that allows developers fond of JavaScript to write software for the back-end |

Back-end developers may also talk about functional programming - where “monad”, “functor”, “optional”, “algebraic data type”,
“Scala” or “Haskell” may be heard - as their preferred style of writing code. This does lead into the discussion about
the paradigms of programming which is out of scope for this document.

### Front-end developer

<figure>
  <picture>
    <source srcset="/assets/2021-02-22/front-end-developer@2x.png" media="(max-width: 600px)"/>
    <source srcset="/assets/2021-02-22/front-end-developer.png" media="(min-width: 601px)"/>
    <img src="/assets/2021-02-22/front-end-developer.jpg" alt="Front-end developer figure" width="640" />
  </picture>
</figure>

**What they do:**  
Writes code to be downloaded by a web browser for display with a user interface.

**What they talk about:**  
The following is a list of topics specific to front-end developers:

| --- | --- | --- |
| Topic | Category | Extra comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML | Programming Language | Defines the structure of a web page |
| CSS | Programming Language | Defines the style for a web page |
| JavaScript | Programming Language | Adds behaviour and interaction to a web page |
| React | Software Library | Combines HTML and JavaScript to define components for the UI |
| React Hooks | Software Concept | Part of React, a paradigm for organizing code within components |
| GraphQL | Software Concept | A specification for defining how data is exchanged between the front-end and back-end. Its strength is flexibility and uses JSON |
| Jest | Software Library | For writing and running unit tests and is used mostly in conjunction with React |

Along with technical expertise, a front-end developer of high calibre is conversant with UI / UX / product principles
and can interpret designs without explicit guidance.

### System engineers

These people advocate for secure and healthy systems. Referred above, they are responsible for the many pieces of the
systems that are running in production or running on “staging” (the test environment).

### Full-stack or “generalist” developers

This role describes someone who is comfortable writing code for the front-end or the back-end. Someone who can, for
example, switch between JavaScript, C# and SQL effortlessly.

When companies are looking for ways to reduce costs, they will expect “specialist” developers to take on more “generalist” responsibilities.

## Conclusion

While this post doesn't delve deeply into what concerns software developers, I hope I have shone a light for you onto their subjects and
cleared some of the mystery.

Communication is a crucial ingredient in teams that thrive. Thus it is important to understand the problems and intent of team members to allow a high level of cooperation and confidence.
