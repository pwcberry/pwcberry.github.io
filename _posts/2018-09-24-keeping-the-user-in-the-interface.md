# Keeping the User in the Interface

For most people software is executed on a computer to automate mundane tasks or to provide real-time information to them. In between is the user interface: the place where people and computers interact. Not enough attention into making this interaction helpful or obstacle-free can cost a business revenue, cause data to be misread, or start a hazardous process that is difficult to terminate.

When creating software, the user interface (UI), or the user experience (UX), really matters. It doesn't have to be beautiful although it makes the UI wonderful if it can be; it just has to provide a familiar place for people to complete their tasks. The UI shouldn't be an after-thought in the software development process.

From the beginning of the project to when the software is actually running, the user must be kept in the interface to ensure the software's success: the user must be like an active participant in the project.

[Introduction should emphasise that this is more for a "developer", or event someone who is just starting out as a front-end/UI developer]

## What is the user interface

A short definition for a user interface would be "the place where someone interacts with a computer". [Wikipedia definition]

This place doesn’t just reside in a browser on the desktop. It’s the mobile device you are attached to; it’s the command line in your terminal; it’s your television. Through this place - this plane - you connect with your computing machine.

You could say the user interface has become an essential part of society. Especially in industrialized and technically advanced cultures where computing has become ubiquitous.

### A short history of the user interface

It is possible that the earliest interface was an abacus (if we remain true to our short definition for a UI). There are other mechanical devices that had an interface of sorts [Charles Babbage]. In this section though we will summarise the history involving electronic computers.

## What makes a great user interface

[Provide a list of references]

There are numerous guidelines for developing UIs and often these are guidelines published by organizations that have software platforms such as Google and Apple. 

**Clear and unambiguous**

**Provides a safe place**

**Memorable**

**Aesthetically pleasing**


### Benefits

For web sites: greater engagement
For online stores: satisfying purchases
For applications: increased productivity
For customers: increased revenue

## What makes a poor user interface

### The costs

Frustrate users
Allow inaccurate data
Can be misleading
Cause customers to lose revenue

**Maintenance costs**
Poorly organized code
Time to “come up to speed”
Technical debt

## Web considerations

Download speed
Semantic HTML
Accessibility
CSS animations and transitions
JavaScript compatibility

Security
Testing
HTTP caching
API end points
UI status updates

### Developer convenience

Tools to enhance developer experience
Frameworks and libraries
Big cost: performance


## Software is about people

Who is the person using your software?
Who is the person paying for your software?
If you can, test
Design is crucial for success


In my day job, the crucial aspect of the user interface can’t be understated. Customers enter data through an administration portal that becomes the information the consumer reads on the page about a house.

These are just two types of user interface: an input form and a web page with interactive components. The exist because people need to use them.

The software required to produce these planes for user interaction has to focus on these people. The design has to have people at the forefront: the user experience. Happy users don’t give up on quality software.

Software does need to be written to manipulate data. Even then, some type of user interface is needed, even if it’s the command line. Sometimes this data is only of use for a specialized group of people.

Data that turns into information or is information transmitted as data becomes of importance to a wider group of people. 

Then information has to be stored somewhere. That information has to be given to a machine, and then the machine needs to display it. All in a meaningful and easy way for the particular person.

The people who use the software is, in general, very different from the person paying for the software.

[There is potential to expand upon the type of customer, the customer’s motivations and who their market is]

People may use the software every day, every hour. People may use the software once in a while. Familiarity, or habituation, helps people. Don’t allow people to find work arounds. You need to understand context.

When you have to create a form to collect information about the person, you shouldn’t make it a 1:1 mapping of a database table. This can cause confusion and lead someone to wonder why so much information is required from them. You should only really need to collect enough information to satisfy business requirements. If a lot of information has to be collected, ensure there are explanations for the extensive list of input fields.

Design is important.

## Understand the language of design

UI design principles
Design patterns
User experience

here are principles in UI design, or visual design, that are still relevant.
Gestalt theory
Positive / negative space
Golden ratio
Visual harmony
Fonts
Colours
Improve the understanding with designers: explain what is possible
The concept of “safety” in design: people can make mistakes without disasters occurring
Application Design patterns – they really haven’t changed much in 10+ years
Mobile Design patterns – pretty much stable in last 3-4 years
User experience
Information architecture
“Dark Patterns”

## Be a champion for the user

Find common ground
Push back on overly-complicated designs
Ensure consistency
Look out for bad practices
Development processes

(Conclusion or Summary)(What is the best way to end an essay or prose piece?)

(Important to keep restating the "keep the user in the interface" theme through each section)

The user interface is the place where someone interacts with a computer. The place, or interaction plane, maybe a wrist watch or the browser on a desktop computer.

The benefits of a well-designed user interface can be defined in increased usage and presence; return visits. The costs of a poorly-designed interface are lack of sales, low reputation and high maintenance costs.
