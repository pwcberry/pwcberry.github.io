# About

My name is Peter Berry, and I am a senior software developer at FTI Ringtail.

I enjoy developing on the full stack of the web. I am also interested in user experience, visual design, and software architecture.

The whole software experience.

On this website I am to share my experiences, which I hope can be perceived as wisdom. There will be some philosophy here.
