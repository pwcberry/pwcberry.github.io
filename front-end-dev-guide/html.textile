h1. HTML

h2(guideline observe). Do use classes as the primary nomenclature for presentation.

It's important to understand that when it comes to presentation for web pages and applications, a CSS class will denote an element, or widget, or container, that is used across pages.

h2(guideline consider). Do use IDs, but sparingly.

IDs within HTML documents denote a unique element within the context of that document.

h2(guideline avoid). Avoid long CSS rules.

This is primarily intended to avoid the situation where the CSS has five levels of nesting to define the presentation attributes of an element.
