{% guideline observe %}

h2. Do use classes as the primary nomenclature for presentation.

It's important to understand that when it comes to presentation for web pages and applications, a CSS class will denote an element, or widget, or container, that is used across pages.

{% guideline consider %}

h2. Do use IDs, but sparingly.

IDs within HTML documents denote a unique element within the context of that document.

{% endguideline %}

{% guideline avoid %}

h2. Avoid long CSS rules.

This is primarily intended to avoid the situation where the CSS has five levels of nesting to define the presentation attributes of an element.
