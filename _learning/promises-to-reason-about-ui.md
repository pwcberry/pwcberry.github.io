Using JavaScript Promises to Reason About User Interaction
==========================================================

* User interactions are essentially asynchronous events
* User interactions occur at a micro-level, that is with DOM elements
* User interactions impact the state for the entire UI - macro-level events such as authorisation
* Using promises, a pattern emerges where the success or failure of an asynchronous action with a service is abstracted away, providing the client code with a simple API to determine a course of action
