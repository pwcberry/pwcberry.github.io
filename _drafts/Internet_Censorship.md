Internet Censorship
===================

Restricting information exchange on the internet brings the spectre of totalitarianism as the people responsible for determining what is reputable information are no longer the people who have a right to access that information - the public - and those who choose to seek that information that has been censored are under threat of prosecution. This type of reasoning by bureaucrats and ageing, fearful politicians will also push criminals and other unscrupulous personalities further into the shadows. Censorship will always provide the ingenious with motivation for circumventing its gates. Censorship, in one way or another, has ultimately failed whenever it was introduced during the last 500 years of western civilisation.
