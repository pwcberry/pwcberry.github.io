# Stateful and functional programming

I've been having many thoughts lately about the purpose of object-oriented programming and functional programming. 

It is possible to define the user interface as a representation of the state of a programm (or application). 

How is it possible to mutate state within the functional style of programming?

Is it possible that object-oriented and functional can co-exist?

I'm working on a couple of applications to work with JavaScript frameworks (it's part of  on-going research into these frameworks).
