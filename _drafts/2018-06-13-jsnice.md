# JS Nice - Exploring minified third-party code

While reading [CACM March 2019]() I read one of the contributed papers about JS Nice.

I've been playing around with it and the code I used to transform was sourced from third-party scripts such as trackers, advertising, monitoring and the like. It's been very interesting.

One of the common things I've seen so far is code that behaves as a polyfill. It makes me think that in this day and age we should be not aiming for the lowest-common denominator (i.e. IE11). If we do, it should be a separate script. We should, as a "community", be sending down the wire only code that works in browsers that have at least 95% implemented ES2015 and bits of the the other subsequent specifications.

```html
<script>
if (window.someFeatureBecauseIE11) {
    document.write('<script src="polyfilled-version.js"><' + '/' + 'script>');
} else {
    document.write('<script src="real-version.js"><' + '/' + 'script>');
}
```

I can't remember if anyone has imposed an "IE tax" but I think it's time to do so. I know some people can't avoid using it (due to enterprise lock-down arrangements) but if the company's internet bill keeps going up because of IE11 usage maybe it can be a signal to do something about that lock-down policy.
