Before you can curb your information intake, you have to come to an understanding of who you are.

What kind of information is essential to your life, to your work? What information answers directly to your need to know? And what are you massing only for the sake of some idea] image you have of what an "informed person" should be?

The pursuit of the former will provide satisfaction; the pursuit of the latter will result in anxiety.

Information that is essential to you will help define who you are and what you do. Information that is extraneous to your life will further reinforce the unsettling distance between who you are and who vou think you should be.
