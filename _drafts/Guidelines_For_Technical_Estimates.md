Guidelines for technical estimates
==================================

* Have an understanding what the minimal amount of effort will be to complete a task
* Consider the degree of familiarity with the codebase.
* Consider the degree of familiarity with the technical aspects of the solution.
* Consider the amount of time required to research the best approach for coding the solution.
* Will the solution require third-party components? Consider time for research.
* Can the problem be decomposed into smaller tasks? (Top-down programming!) (Goals!)
