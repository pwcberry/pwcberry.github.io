h1. The Crowded JavaScript Horizon

There has been some talk in the last couple of months about the direction the Angular.js team have taken.
After reading this article on "QuirksMode":http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/01/the_problem_wit.html and then I read this "article":http://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2014/12/the-state-of-javascript-in-2015/ I decided to poke around with a couple of libraries / frameworks that have appeared on the crowded JavaScript horizon.

I took some time to get my head around a couple of libraries: Ractive.js and Aurelia.
