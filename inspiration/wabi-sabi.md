Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers
======================================================

The Wabi-Sabi Universe
----------------------

Wabi-sabi can be called a "comprehensive" aesthetic system. Its world view, or universe, is self-referential. It provides an integrated approach to the ultimate nature of existence (metaphysics), sacred knowledge (spirituality), emotional well-being (state-of-mind), behaviour (morality), and the look and feel of things (materiality).

The more systematic and clearly defined the components of an aesthetic system are - the more conceptual handles, the more ways it refers back to fundamentals - the more useful it is.

### The Metaphysical Basis of Wabi-Sabi

_What is the universe like?_

__Things are either devolving toward, or evolving from, nothingness__. Wabi-sabi, in its purest, most idealized form, is precisely about delicate traces, the faint evidence, at the borders of nothingness.

While the universe destructs it also constructs. New things emerge out of nothingness. But we can't really determine by cursory observation whether something is in the evolving or devolving mode.

In representations of wabi-sabi, arbitrarily perhaps, the devolving dynamic generally tends to manifest itself in things a little darker, more obscure, and quiet. Things evovling tend to be a little lighter and brighter, a bit clearer, and slightly more eye-arresting. 

Nothingness itself - instead of being an empty space - is alive with possibility. In metaphysical terms, wabi-sabi sugggests that the universe is in constant motion toward or away from potential.

### Wabi-Sabi Spiritual Values

_What are the lessons of the universe?_

__Truth comes from the observation of nature__. 

#### 1. All things are impermanent.

The inclination toward nothingness is unrelenting and universal. Even things that have all the hallmarks of substance - things that are hard, inert, solid - present nothing more than the _illusion_ of permanence.

#### 2. All things are imperfect.

Nothing that exists is without imperfections. When we really look closely at things, we see flaws. Every craftsman knows the limits of perfection: the imperfections glare back.

#### 3. All things are incomplete.

All things, including the universe itself, are in a constant, never-ending state of becoming or dissolving. Often we arbitrarily designate moments, points along the way, as "finished" or "complete". But when does something's destiny finally come to fruition? The notion of completion has no basis in wabi-sabi.

__"Greatness" exists in the inconspicuous and overlooked details"__. Wabi-sabi is not found in nature at moments of bloomn and lushness, but at moments of inception or subsiding. Wabi-sabi is not about gorgeous flowers, majestic trees or bold landscapes. Wabi-sabi is about the minor and the hidden, the tentative and the ephemeral: things so subtle and evanescent they are invisible to vulgar eyes.

The closer things get to nonexistence, the more exquisite and evocative they become. 

To experience wabi-sabi, means you have to slow way down, be patient, and look very closely.

__Beauty can be coaxed out of ugliness__. Wabi-sabi is ambivalent about separating beauty from non-beauty or ugliness. 

Wabi-sabi suggests that beauty is a dynamic event that occurs between you and something else. Beauty can spontaneously occur at any moment given the proper circumstances, context, or point-of-view. Beauty is thus an altered state of consciousness, an extraordinary moment of poetry and grace.

### The Wabi-Sabi State of Mind

_How do we feel about what we know?_

__Acceptance of the inevitable__. Wabi-sabi is an aesthetic appreciation of the evanescence of life. Wabi-sabi images forces us to contemplate our own mortality, and they evoke an existential loneliness and tender sadness. They also stir a mingled bittersweet comfort, since we know all existence shares the same fate.

Fujiwara no Teika (1162-1241) wrote:

	All around, no flowers in bloom
	Nor maple leaves in glare,
	A solitary fisherman's hut alone
	On the twilight shore
	Of this autumn eve.
</pre>

__Appreciation of the cosmic order__. Wabi-sabi suggests the subtlest realms and all the mechanics and dynamics of existence, way beyond what our ordinary sesnes can perceive. These primordial forces are evoked in everything wabi-sabi in much the same way that Hindu mandalas or medieval European cathedrals were constructed to emotionally convey their respective cosmic schemes. 

The materials out of which things wabi-sabi are made elicit these transcendent feelings.

### Wabi-Sabi Moral Precepts

_Knowing what we know, how should we act?_

__Get rid of all that is unnecessary.__ Wabi-sabi means treading lightly on the planet and knowing how to appreciate whatever is encountered, no matter how trifling, whenever it is encountered.

Wabi-sabi acknowledges that just as it is important to know when to make choices, it is also important to know when _not_ to make choices: to let things be.

Wabi-sabi is exactly about the delicate balance between the pleasure we get from things and the pleasure we get from freedom from things.

__Focus on the intrinsic and ignore material hierarchy.__ Hierarchical thinking - "this is higher/better, that is lower/worse" - is not acceptable. Humility and egalitarism are intrinsic values of wabi-sabi. In wabi-sabi, "valuable" implies "not valuable": an object only has its intrinsic qualities, and achieves the state of wabi-sabi only for the moment it is appreciated as such.

### The Material Qualities of Wabi-Sabi

_What objects/motifs/juxtapositions express our understanding of the universe, or create that understanding in others?_

__The suggestion of natural process.__ Things wabi-sabi are expressions of time frozen. They are made of materials that are visibly vulnerable to the effects of weathering and human treatment. They record the sun, wind, rain, heat and cold in a language of discolouratoin, rust, tarnish, stain, warping, shrikning, shriveling, and cracking.

Though things wabi-sabi may be on the point of dematerialization (or materialization) they still possess an undiminished poise and strength of character.

__Irregular.__ Things wabi-sabi are indifferent to conventional good taste. Since we already know what the "correct" design solutions are, wabi-sabi thoughtfully offers the "wrong" solutions. As a result, things wabi-sabi often appear odd, misshapen, awkward or what many people would consider ugly. 

Things wabi-sabi may exhibit the effects of an accident, like a broken bowl glued back together again.

__Intimate.__ Things wabi-sabi are usually small and compact, quiet and inward-oriented. They beckon: get close, touch, relate. They inspire a reduction of the psychic distance between one thing and another thing; between people and things.

Places wabi-sabi are small, secluded, and private environments that enhance one's capacity for metaphysical musings. They are a world apart: nowhere, anywhere, everywhere.

__Unpretentious.__ Thing wabi-sabi are unstudied and inevitable looking. They do not blare out "I am important" or demand to be the centre of attention. They are understated and unassuming, yet not without presence or quiet authority. Things wabi-sabi easily co-exist with the rest of their environment.

Things wabi-sabi are appreciated only during direct contact and use. They have no need for documentation of provenance. It is best if the creator is of no distinction, invisible, or anonymous.

__Earthy.__ Things wabi-sabi can appear coarse and unrefined. They are usually made from materials not far removed from their original condition within, or upon, the earth and are rich in raw texture and rough tactile sensation. Their craftmanship may be impossible to discern.

__Murky.__ Things wabi-sabi have a vague, blurry, or attenuated quality - as things do as they approach nothingness (or come out of it). Once-hard edges taken on a soft pale glow. Once-substantial materiality appears almost sponge-like. Once-bright saturated colours fade into muddy earth tones or the smoky hues of dawn and dusk. Wabi-sabi comes in an infinite spectrum of greys and browns, muted greens, blacks.

Less often, things wabi-sabi can also come in the light, almost pastel colours associated with a recent emergence from nothingness. Like the off-whites of unbleached cotton. The silver-rusts of saplings and sprouts. The green-browns of tumescent buds.

__Simple.__ Simplicity is at the core of things wabi-sabi. Nothingness, of course, is the ultimate simplicity. But before and after nothingness, simplicity is not so simple. How do you exercise the restraint that simplicity requires without crossing over into ostentatious austerity? How do you pay attention to all the necessary details without becoming excessively fussy? How do you achieve simplicity without inviting boredom?

The simplicity of wabi-sabi is probably best described as the state of grace arrived at by a sober, modest, heartfelt intelligence. The main strategy of this intelligence is economy of means. Pare down to the essence, but don't remove the poetry. Keep things clean and unemcumbered, but don't sterilize. (Things wabi-sabi are emotionally warm, never cold.)

A limited palette of materials keeping conspicuous features to a minimum that does not remove the connective tissue that binds elements into a meaningful whole. It does not mean to diminish something's "interestingness", the quality that compels us to look at that something over, and over, and over again.
